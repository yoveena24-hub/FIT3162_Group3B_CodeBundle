# USER PROFILING AND RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS USING USER GENERATED CONTENT

This project aims at reducing marketing cost by using sentiment analysis techniques. User generated content for 1 year has been obtained from the online social platform, Reddit. The information is processed and a list of reddit users that are influencers and potential clients to a particular product are extracted. Those are used as inputs to a user recommender system web application. This application will be made available to vendors so that they can directly contact and make advertising to users that are interested in their brand or product. The second phase of the project is to perform the score prediction of a post; for Reddit social platform, 'score' is defined as the number of upvotes against the number of downvotes. Using various posts' attributes, different machine learning algorithms have been used for score prediction. The output allows us determine whether there is a relationship between an influencer and score of his post.
